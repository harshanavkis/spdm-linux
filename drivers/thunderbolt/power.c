/*
 * Apple provides the following means for power control in ACPI:
 *
 * * On Macs with Thunderbolt 1 Gen 1 controllers (Light Ridge, Eagle Ridge):
 *   * XRPE method ("Power Enable"), takes argument 1 or 0, toggles a GPIO pin
 *     to switch the controller on or off.
 *   * XRIN named object (alternatively _GPE), contains number of a GPE which
 *     fires as long as something is plugged in (regardless of power state).
 *   * XRIL method ("Interrupt Low"), returns 0 as long as something is
 *     plugged in, 1 otherwise.
 *   * XRIP and XRIO methods, unused by macOS driver.
 *
 * * On Macs with Thunderbolt 1 Gen 2 controllers (Cactus Ridge 4C):
 *   * XRIN not only fires as long as something is plugged in, but also as long
 *     as the controller's CIO switch is powered up.
 *   * XRIL method changed its meaning, it returns 0 as long as the CIO switch
 *     is powered up, 1 otherwise.
 *   * Additional SXFP method ("Force Power"), accepts only argument 0,
 *     switches the controller off. This carries out just the raw power change,
 *     unlike XRPE which disables the link on the PCIe Root Port in an orderly
 *     fashion before switching off the controller.
 *   * Additional SXLV, SXIO, SXIL methods to utilize the Go2Sx and Ok2Go2Sx
 *     pins (see background below). Apparently SXLV toggles the value given to
 *     the POC via Go2Sx (0 or 1), SXIO changes the direction (0 or 1) and SXIL
 *     returns the value received from the POC via Ok2Go2Sx.
 *   * On some Macs, additional XRST method, takes argument 1 or 0, asserts or
 *     deasserts a GPIO pin to reset the controller.
 *   * On Macs introduced 2013, XRPE was renamed TRPE.
 *
 * * On Macs with Thunderbolt 2 controllers (Falcon Ridge 4C and 2C):
 *   * SXLV, SXIO, SXIL methods to utilize Go2Sx and Ok2Go2Sx are gone.
 *   * On the MacPro6,1 which has multiple Thunderbolt controllers, each NHI
 *     device has a separate XRIN GPE and separate TRPE, SXFP and XRIL methods.
 *
 * Background:
 *
 * * Gen 1 controllers (Light Ridge, Eagle Ridge) had no power management
 *   and no ability to distinguish whether a DP or Thunderbolt device is
 *   plugged in. Apple put an ARM Cortex MCU (NXP LPC1112A) on the logic board
 *   which snoops on the connector lines and, depending on the type of device,
 *   sends an HPD signal to the GPU or rings the Thunderbolt XRIN doorbell
 *   interrupt. The switches for the 3.3V and 1.05V power rails to the
 *   Thunderbolt controller are toggled by a GPIO pin on the southbridge.
 *
 * * On gen 2 controllers (Cactus Ridge 4C), Intel integrated the MCU into the
 *   controller and called it POC. This caused a change of semantics for XRIN
 *   and XRIL. The POC is powered by a separate 3.3V rail which is active even
 *   in sleep state S4. It only draws a very small current. The regular 3.3V
 *   and 1.05V power rails are no longer controlled by the southbridge but by
 *   the POC. In other words the controller powers *itself* up and down! It is
 *   instructed to do so with the Go2Sx pin. Another pin, Ok2Go2Sx, allows the
 *   controller to indicate if it is ready to power itself down. Apple wires
 *   Go2Sx and Ok2Go2Sx to the same GPIO pin on the southbridge, hence the pin
 *   is used bidirectionally. A third pin, Force Power, is intended by Intel
 *   for debug only but Apple abuses it for XRPE/TRPE and SXFP. Perhaps it
 *   leads to larger power saving gains. They utilize Go2Sx and Ok2Go2Sx only
 *   on Cactus Ridge, presumably because the controller somehow requires that.
 *   On Falcon Ridge they forego these pins and rely solely on Force Power.
 *
 * Implementation Notes:
 *
 * * To conform to Linux' hierarchical power management model, power control
 *   is governed by the topmost PCI device of the controller, which is the
 *   upstream bridge. The controller is powered down once all child devices
 *   of the upstream bridge have suspended and its autosuspend delay has
 *   elapsed.
 *
 * * The autosuspend delay is user configurable via sysfs and should be lower
 *   or equal to that of the NHI since hotplug events are not acted upon if
 *   the NHI has suspended but the controller has not yet powered down.
 *   However the delay should not be zero to avoid frequent power changes
 *   (e.g. multiple times just for lspci -vv) since powering up takes 2 sec.
 *   (Powering down is almost instantaneous.)
