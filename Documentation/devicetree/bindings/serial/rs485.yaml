title: RS485 serial communications Bindings

description: The RTS signal is capable of automatically controlling line
  direction for the built-in half-duplex mode. The properties described
  hereafter shall be given to a half-duplex capable UART node.

        - description: "Driver Enable to Output Delay" in nanoseconds as given
            in the transceiver datasheet. Specifies the delay between enabling
            the driver (assertion of RTS) and transmission of the start bit.
            For most transceivers it's so short that it can safely be omitted.
          default: 0
          maximum: 20000
        - description: "Driver Propagation Delay" in nanoseconds as given in
            the transceiver datasheet. Specifies the delay between transmission
            of the stop bit and disabling the driver (deassertion of RTS).
            The delay allows the stop bit to transition through the transceiver
            before its driver is disabled.
          default: 0
          maximum: 20000
